Basics:-

1.t1.py:-describes the usage of arg parser

2.t2.py:- image description

3.t3.py:- pixel dexcription

4.t4.py:-

          line will have a start and end point (x1,y1)  and (x2,y2)
          cv2.line(canvas_name,starting_point,ending point,color)
          
 5.t5.py:-
 
            step1:-Declare canvas shape
            step2:-np.zeros for canvas formation
            step3:-show canvas image 
            step4:-(b,g,r),255 is highest value declare red color tuple as (0,0,255) and green as 

                blue=(255,0,0)
                green=(0,255,0)
                red=(0,0,255)
            step5:-draw line on the canvas from pt1 to pt2

            here in this example code overwritten of lines in canvas will occur
    6.t5.py:-
              Aim to draw the create canvas and create rectangle
              step1:-create canvas and color tuples,blue=(255,0,0),green=(0,255,0),red=(0,0,255)
              step2:-create pt1 and pt2 co-ordinates tuples
              step3:-use cv2.rectangle api to draw rectangle
